# JavaScript Library Project

This is a personal project built as part of **The Odin Project (TOP) JavaScript course**.
The goal was to create a simple library app where users can add, display, toggle read status, and delete books.

## Features

- Add new books with title, author, number of pages, and read status.
- Display books in visually clean card layout.
- Toggle the read/unread status for each book.
- Delete books from the library.
- Form appears as an overlay modal for a smooth user experience.
- Data is stored temporarily in memory (resets on page reload).

---

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – main HTML structure.
- `style.css` – styling for library cards, form modal, and interactions.
- `app.js` – core JavaScript functionality:
  - Book constructor
  - Library array management
  - Display logic
  - Event handling for add, delete, and toggle read status

> Note: Folder and file templates were generated by the IDE (HTML5 Boilerplate). HTML/CSS were assisted by ChatGPT, while JavaScript was written manually for practice and learning purposes.

---

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click **Add New Book** to open the form modal.
3. Fill in the book details and save.
4. Use the checkbox to toggle read status or the delete button to remove books.
5. The library resets on page reload as no persistent storage is implemented.
